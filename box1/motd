Oh Hi!  Welcome to the first challenge, do you have what it takes?

Only port 22 is available from the outside so you must set up an ssh tunnel to the listener.

Write a python script to connect to your local port and complete the challenge.

Complete the challenge to connect to bob@box2 using the flag as the password.
